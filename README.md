# STA518_Final_Project_Shiny_Tree
The goal is to make a shiny app that allows users to explore FASTA sequences by plotting sequence graphs and phylogenetic trees. As well as with features to downloads and generate figures/pdfs. 

# What is this project? / What is its goal?
This project is going to be a Shiny App where users can observe similarities, differences and connections in DNA/RNA/protein sequences in the from of a FASTA file. A FASTA file is a text base sequence of nucleotides or proteins that are represented using single-letter codes in the file. This format is common in all bioinformatic/biochemistry/molecular biology field.

How we will observe these behaviors of multiple sequences is through the uses of phylogenetic trees. Which are a form of tree diagram linking the evolutionary relationship between the sequences.
